"This dataset, titled \"R24-F1_Cuestionario Salud Oral_Manual,\" comprises a series of variables related to oral health assessments collected through a questionnaire. The dataset includes identifiers such as 'proyecto', 'folio', 'foliocc', and 'etapa', alongside participant details like 'participante', 'stage', 'id', 'fecha', and 'EDAD'. It also captures the date of the interview broken down into day ('FECHA_DD'), month ('FECHA_MM'), and year ('FECHA_AA'), as well as the interviewer's code ('COD_ENT'). The core of the dataset consists of a series of questions (PREG1 to PREG12) that inquire about the participant's last dental visit, reasons for the visit, frequency of dental issues, and personal dental care habits, with multiple-choice responses that gauge the frequency and severity of oral health issues. Additional observations can be noted in the 'OBS' field."
