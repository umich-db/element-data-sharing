"This dataset contains information related to the fluoride content in plasma or urine samples across different cohorts. The columns include identifiers like 'PROYECTO' for the cohort, 'FOLIO' for the cohort-specific ID, and 'ID' for the sample ID, among others. It also includes measurements from two aliquots labeled as '_F_u_ml_A' and '_F_u_ml_B', representing the fluoride content in milligrams per milliliter, along with statistical data such as 'Mean', 'Error', 'SD', and 'Perc_RSD' which denote the average, error, standard deviation, and percent relative standard deviation respectively. The dataset is structured to facilitate analysis of fluoride levels across different stages and cohorts, indicated by 'Etapa' and 'Stage'."
