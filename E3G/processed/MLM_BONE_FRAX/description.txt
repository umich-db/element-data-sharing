"This dataset, part of the R01MB-M_BONE project, is designed for fracture and risk assessment using the Fracture and Risk Assessment Tool (Frax_R01MB-M). It includes variables such as participant demographics (age, sex, country), health indicators (weight, height, BMI), and risk factors (previous fractures, parental hip fractures, smoking status, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary osteoporosis, and alcohol consumption). The dataset also records specific outcomes like osteoporotic measurements and hip fractures. Each entry is uniquely identified by an ID and includes a study date for reference."
