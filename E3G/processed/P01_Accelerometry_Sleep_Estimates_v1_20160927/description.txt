"This dataset contains various variables related to sleep and activity monitoring, with columns such as 'folio', 'filename', 'n_weardays', 'wear_day', 'nominal_day', 'valid_accel_data', and several others related to sleep estimation and diary records. Key variables include 'diary_bed', 'diary_wake', 'est_bed', 'est_wake', and corresponding sleep duration in minutes ('diary_sleep_dur_mins', 'est_sleep_dur_mins'). Additional metrics such as 'totaltime_diff', 'MI_diary', 'FI_diary', 'MI_est', 'FI_est', and 'good_est' provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the estimated sleep parameters compared to diary records. This dataset is useful for analyzing sleep patterns and the effectiveness of wearable technology in sleep tracking."
