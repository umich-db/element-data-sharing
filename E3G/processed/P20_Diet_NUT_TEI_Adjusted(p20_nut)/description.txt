The columns represent various nutrients and food components, both in their raw and energy-adjusted forms (e.g., 'ener_kcal' for energy in kilocalories, 'proteina_adj' for adjusted protein content). The rows detail specific food items, categorized by food groups such as dairy, fruits, meats, vegetables, grains, and beverages, with additional categories for processed foods, Mexican dishes, and sweetened products. Each food item is identified by a unique name in the database, with descriptions provided in both English and Spanish. The dataset is structured to facilitate the analysis of dietary intake and nutritional content across different types of foods."
