The columns include various nutrient metrics such as energy in kcal and kJ, macronutrients like carbohydrates, protein, and fats, as well as vitamins, minerals, and other components like caffeine and fiber.

Each food item is identified by a unique 'PROYECTO' and 'FOLIO' code, and the dataset includes both raw and Total Energy Intake (TEI)-adjusted names for food groups.
