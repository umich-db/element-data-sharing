"This dataset appears to be a comprehensive collection of nutritional data focused on vitamin and mineral intake, as well as other dietary components. It includes variables such as project identifiers, participant details, and the date and location of data collection. The dataset quantifies daily intake of various nutrients like folic acid, vitamins A through K, macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats), and minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, etc.), along with other dietary compounds such as caffeine, choline, and ginseng. Each nutrient is measured in appropriate units such as micrograms, milligrams, or international units per day. The dataset also includes a note on Dietary Folate Equivalents, which are calculated based on food folate and folic acid from fortified foods or supplements, referencing a study on the interpretation and application of these equivalents."
