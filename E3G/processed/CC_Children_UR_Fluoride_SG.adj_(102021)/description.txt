"This dataset contains information related to a Cholesterol study focused on adolescent urine fluoride levels during the initial visit (V0). It includes unique subject identifiers (PROYECTO + FOLIO and FOLIOCC), the study visit stage (Etapa), and quality-checked fluoride measurements (F_qualitycheck). Additionally, the dataset provides the relative standard deviation (RSD) of samples, typically measured in duplicate, and specific gravity values (specific_gravity) obtained alongside mercury measurements. The dataset also features adjusted fluoride concentrations (SG.adjusted.fluoride), calculated using a formula that normalizes fluoride levels to a median specific gravity of 1.020."
