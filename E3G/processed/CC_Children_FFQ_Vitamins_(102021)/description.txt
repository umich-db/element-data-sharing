The columns include identifiers for projects, folios, and stages, as well as personal information such as date of birth, visit date, sex, and age. Nutritional data encompasses both macronutrients (e.g., calories, protein, lipids, carbohydrates) and micronutrients (e.g., vitamins like folic acid, vitamin A, vitamin C, and minerals like calcium, iron, zinc). Additional details include food source codes, food group classifications, and information on whether foods are fortified, processed, or enriched. The dataset also contains bilingual descriptions (Spanish and English) for each nutrient and food classification, making it a valuable resource for nutritional analysis and research."
