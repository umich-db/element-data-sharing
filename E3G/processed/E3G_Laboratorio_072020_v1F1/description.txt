"This dataset appears to be a collection of clinical laboratory test results, likely related to a project named \"TRIADA.\" It includes a variety of hematological and biochemical parameters such as leukocyte count (leu), erythrocyte count (eri), hemoglobin (hgb), hematocrit (hct), mean corpuscular volume (vcm), platelet count (plq), cholesterol levels (chol), and glucose levels (gluc_god), among others. Each record is associated with a participant's ID, the project stage, and the date of the study. Additional information such as percentages and absolute counts of different types of white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) and observations (obs) are also included."
