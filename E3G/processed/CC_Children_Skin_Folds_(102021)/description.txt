"This dataset appears to be related to a cohort study involving mother and child participants, with various anthropometric and demographic data points. The columns include identifiers for the project ('proyecto') with different cohort codes, participant folios ('folio' and 'foliocc'), visit stages ('stage', 'etapa' with specific visit codes), dates of birth and visit dates for the child ('fechanac_ch', 'fecha_visita'), as well as sex and age of the child ('sex_ch', 'edad_ch'). Additionally, it contains measurements of anthropometric data for both mothers (e.g., height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure) and children (e.g., subscapularis fold, suprailiac fold, biceps crease, fat mass). Each row provides a variable name, a description, a value, and occasionally an observation or note."
