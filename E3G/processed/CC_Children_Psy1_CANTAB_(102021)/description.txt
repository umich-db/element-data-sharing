"This dataset appears to be related to a study on the Fetal Origins of Neurobehavior, specifically examining the interaction between lead exposure and cholesterol metabolism in children. It includes a wide range of variables, such as project identifiers ('proyecto', 'folio', 'foliocc'), visitation dates ('fecha_visita'), demographic information ('sex_ch', 'Age_yrs'), and various test scores and measurements from cognitive assessments (e.g., 'c_dmsa', 'c_dmsb', 'c_iedcse', 'c_iedcst') and biological samples (e.g., 'leu', 'eri', 'hgb'). The dataset also contains variables related to the BRIEF (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) questionnaire, assessing different aspects of executive function in children ('c_inhibic_n', 'c_shift_a_n', 'c_econtrol_n'). Additionally, it includes Cantab test variables, which are cognitive assessments ('c_dmsa', 'c_dmsb', 'c_mtsmcmt', 'c_mtsmcrt'), and BASC (Behavior Assessment System for Children) self-report variables for different age groups. The dataset is structured with variable names and corresponding labels, providing a comprehensive overview of the neurobehavioral development of children in relation to environmental and biological factors."
