"This dataset appears to be related to body composition measurements, likely derived from an InBody device, which is used to analyze various physical health parameters. The columns include identifiers like 'proyecto', 'folio', and 'USER_ID', as well as personal information such as 'Height', 'DateofBirth', 'Gender', and 'Age'. It also contains detailed body composition metrics like 'Weight', 'TBWTotalBodyWater', 'Protein', 'Minerals', 'BFMBodyFatMass', 'FFMFatFreeMass', 'SMMSkeletalMuscleMass', 'BMIBodyMassIndex', and 'PBFPercentBodyFat', along with their respective normal ranges. Additionally, the dataset includes impedance measurements at different frequencies for various body parts, which are used to estimate body composition, and other health indicators such as 'BMRBasalMetabolicRate', 'WHRWaistHipRatio', and 'VFLVisceralFatLevel'. The 'Observaciones' column suggests that there may be additional notes or comments on the measurements."
