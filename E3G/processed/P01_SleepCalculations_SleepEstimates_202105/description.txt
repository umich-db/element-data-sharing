"This dataset includes various sleep-related parameters derived from both a published sleep detection algorithm (PDP) and manual analysis. The dataset columns include estimates of bed and wake times (bed_time_PDP, wake_time_PDP), sleep duration (SleepDur_PDP) from the PDP algorithm, and corresponding final values adjusted after manual analysis if necessary (bed_time_FINAL, wake_time_FINAL, SleepDur_FINAL). Additional metrics such as the Movement Index (Est_MI) and Fragmentation Index (Est_FI) are calculated based on the final sleep window. Manual analysis is conducted when PDP sleep duration falls outside the thresholds of >16 hours or <3 hours, with indicators provided in the 'Manual Analysis' column."
