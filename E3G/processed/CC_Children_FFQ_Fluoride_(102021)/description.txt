"This dataset appears to be a nutritional survey or food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that includes a variety of food items and beverages, along with their descriptions in both Spanish and English. The columns include identifiers such as 'proyecto', 'folio', and 'foliocc', as well as demographic information like 'stage', 'etapa', 'fechanac_ch', 'fecha_visita', 'sex_ch', 'edad_ch', 'edad', 'asistencia', 'f_usda', 'fluoruros', and 'fluoruros_beb'. Each row represents a different food item, with the first column providing the Spanish term, the second column offering a variation or misspelling of the Spanish term, the third column providing a standardized Spanish term, and the fourth column giving the English translation. The dataset covers a wide range of food categories, including dairy, fruits, vegetables, meats, beverages, and snacks, and it also includes information on whether items are added to other foods, such as sugar to milk, or if they are consumed plain, like water. Some rows also indicate dietary supplements like vitamins and ferrous sulfate."
