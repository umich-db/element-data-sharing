"This dataset appears to be related to a study on the Fetal Origins of Neurobehavior, specifically focusing on the interaction between lead exposure and cholesterol metabolism in children. It includes a wide range of variables such as anthropometric measurements (weight, height, BMI), biological samples (leucocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, etc.), and neurobehavioral assessments (commission errors, response styles, perseverations). Additionally, the dataset contains scores from the BRIEF (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) questionnaire and Cantab (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) cognitive tests, which assess various aspects of cognitive function and executive control. The dataset is structured with variable labels and identifiers for tracking project stages, visit dates, and individual participant data."
