"The dataset \"Historical_Children_Psy3_HOME.csv\" contains information on various home environment factors related to child development, as part of a cohort study. It includes a 'proyecto' column indicating the cohort group (with codes PL for Cohort 2A, BI for Cohort 2B, and SF for Cohort 3), a 'folio' column for the cohort-specific ID, and a 'stage' column for the stage of the study. The dataset also features columns 'home1' through 'home8' representing different environmental factors such as Learning Materials, Language Stimulation, and Physical Environment, with a 'hometot' column summarizing the Total Scores. Additionally, there is an 'edad' column, likely indicating the age of the children."
