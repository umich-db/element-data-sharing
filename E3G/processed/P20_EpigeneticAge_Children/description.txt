"This dataset contains epigenetic and sample information from a study, with variables including sample identifiers, batch information, and biological estimates derived from DNA methylation data. Key variables include unique sample names, barcode labels for EPIC array linkage, and various epigenetic age acceleration measures such as Horvath and Hannum clocks, alongside estimated cell-type proportions using the Houseman method. The dataset also includes principal components (PC1-PC5) to account for batch effects, and timing of sample collection (Etapa) with specific codes for different study visits. Recommendations for analysis suggest considering batch variables and cell-type proportions as potential confounders, and modeling residual variables as outcomes of interest."
