This dataset provides a detailed analysis of average daily wake and sleep patterns, calculated using a sleep diary and accelerometer data. It includes variables such as participant identifiers, total average wake time, and total average sleep time. The dataset also breaks down wake time into various activity levels, including inactive, light, moderate, and vigorous, all averaged over the observation period. Additionally, it tracks the percentage of time the accelerometer was not worn and includes the number of days used in the weekday or weekend calculations. The dataset distinguishes between weekday and weekend patterns, offering insights into how daily routines vary across different days of the week.
