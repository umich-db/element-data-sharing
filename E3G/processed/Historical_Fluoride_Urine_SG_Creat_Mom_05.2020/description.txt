"This dataset contains maternal urinary fluoride measurements from three trimesters of pregnancy, with samples analyzed in either Michigan or Indiana labs, denoted by 'M' or 'I' respectively. Each subject is uniquely identified by a combination of 'PROYECTO' and 'FOLIO'. Quality checks and relative standard deviation (RSD) values are provided for each trimester, with the caveat that only samples with RSD less than 10 should be used, except for certain cases with missing RSD from the Indiana lab. Additionally, the dataset includes creatinine levels and specific gravity measurements from the same urine samples, which are used to adjust fluoride values using provided formulas to account for hydration status, with separate calculations for creatinine adjustment and specific gravity adjustment."
