"This dataset provides detailed sleep metrics collected over two distinct time periods, labeled as time 1 and time 2. Each time period includes variables such as average sleep duration, sleep duration standard deviation, average bedtime, wake time, midpoint of sleep, movement index, and fragmentation index for both weekdays and weekends. Additionally, each set of metrics concludes with the total number of days with valid data. The dataset is structured to facilitate comparisons between the two time periods across various sleep-related parameters, offering insights into patterns and potential changes in sleep behavior."
