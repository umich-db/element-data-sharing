"This dataset appears to be related to a study on the Fetal Origins of Neurobehavior, focusing on the interaction between lead exposure and cholesterol metabolism in children. It includes a wide range of variables such as project identifiers ('proyecto', 'folio', 'foliocc'), demographic information ('etapa', 'stage', 'sex_ch', 'Age_yrs', 'fecha_visita'), and various neurobehavioral and cognitive assessments (e.g., 'c_inhibit_n', 'c_shift_a_n', 'c_econtrol_n'). Additionally, the dataset contains biological sample data (e.g., 'leu', 'eri', 'hgb'), anthropometric measurements (e.g., 'weight_ch', 'height_ch'), and results from the BRIEF questionnaire assessing executive functions. It also includes Cantab test results, which are cognitive assessments, and various other scores and classifications related to neurobehavioral performance and health indicators in children."
