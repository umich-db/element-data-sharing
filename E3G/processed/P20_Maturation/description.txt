"This dataset appears to be related to the study of pubertal development and includes both self-reported and physician-observed Tanner staging, which is a scale of physical development in children, adolescents, and adults. The dataset contains columns for participant identification ('FOLIOCC'), sex ('sex_ch'), developmental stage ('Etapa'), date of maturity assessment ('fecha_madurez'), age at assessment ('Age_H'), and various Tanner staging responses ('TN13' to 'TN15_4B'). It also includes questions about menstruation, shaving or waxing habits, and specific pubertal changes ('F5' to 'M8'). The 'Pubertal_onset' column is computed based on physician observations and indicates the onset of puberty. The dataset is designed to capture detailed information on the physical changes during puberty for both male and female participants."
