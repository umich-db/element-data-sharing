"This dataset appears to be structured with four columns, each representing a different attribute related to a project. The columns are labeled 'Proyecto' for the project name or identifier, 'Folio' which could be a reference number or document identifier, 'Foliocc' which seems to be a unique identifier, possibly for tracking or cross-referencing purposes, and 'Cdii_ccdiet' which stands for Child's Dietary Inflammatory Index, likely a measure or score related to the dietary assessment of children within the project. The first row contains the column headers in Spanish, while the second row provides the English translation of these headers."
