"This dataset appears to be structured with four columns: 'proyecto', 'folio', 'stage', and 'breastmilk_pb'. The first row contains the column headers, indicating the type of data each column represents. The terms suggest that the dataset may be related to a project ('proyecto'), with each entry or record having a unique identifier ('folio'), a particular phase or 'stage' it is in, and a measurement or indicator related to lead in breastmilk ('breastmilk_pb'). The second row provides English translations for the column headers, with 'project' corresponding to 'proyecto', 'file' to 'folio', 'stage' remaining the same, and 'Breastmilk Lead' as the translation for 'breastmilk_pb'."
