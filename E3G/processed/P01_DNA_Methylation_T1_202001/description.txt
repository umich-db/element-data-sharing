"This dataset contains DNA methylation data from ELEMENT participants who provided blood samples during the P01-T1 study visit as of June 2018. The data includes methylation percentages at specific CpG sites for genes such as LINE1, H19, HSD11B2, and PPARA, measured using Pyrosequencing. Each sample's data includes information on the Pyrosequencing plate, date, and duplication status, with duplicated samples representing the average of replicates that passed quality control. The dataset is structured to facilitate analysis of epigenetic modifications in blood leukocytes, with additional details on sample collection, participant details, and analytical methods used, ensuring comprehensive coverage for research into epigenetic influences on health."
