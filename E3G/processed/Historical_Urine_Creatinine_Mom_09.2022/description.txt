"This dataset appears to be related to a study tracking maternal urine creatinine levels at various stages before and after childbirth. The columns include 'PROYECTO' and 'FOLIO' which likely refer to project identifiers, followed by a series of 'creat' columns that represent measurements of urine creatinine during the three trimesters of pregnancy ('creat_11', 'creat_12', 'creat_13'), and at four different time points postpartum (1 month 'creat_21', 4 months 'creat_24', 7 months 'creat_27', and 12 months 'creat_212'). The first row of the dataset contains the column headers, while the second row provides a description of each column, indicating the specific time frame of the creatinine measurement."
