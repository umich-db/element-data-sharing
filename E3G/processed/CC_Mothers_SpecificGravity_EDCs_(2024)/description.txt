"This dataset appears to be structured with four columns: 'ID', 'foliocc', 'Etapa', and 'Specific_gravity'. The 'ID' column likely contains unique identifiers for each entry in the dataset. The 'foliocc' column's purpose is not immediately clear from the description, but it may represent a specific code or classification. The 'Etapa' column indicates the stage of a process or development, and the 'Specific_gravity' column contains values related to the density of a substance compared to a reference substance (usually water for liquids). The first row of the dataset contains the column headers, while the second row provides an example of the data, with actual values for the unique identifier, stage, and specific gravity."
