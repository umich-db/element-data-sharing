"This dataset comprises a comprehensive list of 41 columns, each representing different biochemical markers and hormones, such as Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), and Cortisol, among others. The first three columns include 'FOLIOCC' as a unique identifier, 'ETAPA' indicating the stage, and 'Sample__' as the sample identifier. Each row beyond the first three provides specific measurements for these markers in various units like nmol/L, ng/mL, and pg/mL. This dataset is crucial for analyzing and understanding the hormonal and biochemical profiles in different stages or conditions represented by 'ETAPA'."
