"This dataset appears to be structured with two columns, where the first column lists variable names and the second column provides their meanings. The variables include 'Foliocc', 'Etapa', 'Stage', 'Participant', 'Generacion', and 'spec_grav', which correspond to meanings that are mostly identical to their variable names, with the exception of 'spec_grav', which stands for 'specific gravity'. The dataset seems to be designed for bilingual (English and Spanish) usage, as indicated by the presence of both English and Spanish terms for certain variables, such as 'Etapa' (Spanish) and 'Stage' (English), and 'Generacion' (Spanish) for 'Generation'."
