"This dataset appears to consist of four columns: 'proyecto', 'folio', 'foliocc', and 'Momscho_dii'. The 'proyecto' column likely refers to the project name or identifier, 'folio' could be a file or record number associated with the project, 'foliocc' seems to be a unique identifier for each entry, and 'Momscho_dii' is an index measuring the dietary inflammatory potential of a mother's diet. The first row of the dataset provides the column headers, while the second row offers a brief English translation or description of each column's content."
