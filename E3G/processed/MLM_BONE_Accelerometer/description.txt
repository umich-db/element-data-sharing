"This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of physical activity and sedentary behavior, collected through accelerometer data as part of the R01 - MLM project. It includes variables such as participant demographics (age, gender, weight), activity metrics (calories burned, METs, and time spent in various activity intensities), and detailed movement counts across different axes. The dataset also references the Freedson 1998 method for categorizing physical activity into bouts, and includes data on sedentary episodes and breaks. Additionally, it captures step counts, illumination levels, and the total number of epochs, offering a detailed view of participants' physical activity patterns over the study period."
