"This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of physical activity metrics collected from subjects across various stages of a study. Each record includes personal identifiers and demographic information such as subject ID, age, gender, and weight, along with detailed activity data captured through devices measuring steps, calories burned, and activity intensity levels (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous). The dataset also includes metrics related to energy expenditure such as average calories burned per day and per hour, METs (Metabolic Equivalent of Task), and activity counts across three axes. Additionally, it details the duration and frequency of activity bouts according to the Freedson 1998 guidelines, as well as sedentary bouts and breaks, providing insights into the subjects' activity patterns and sedentary behaviors."
