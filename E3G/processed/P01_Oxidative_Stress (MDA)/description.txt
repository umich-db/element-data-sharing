"This dataset contains a column labeled 'TBARS µM' which represents the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) measured in micromoles per liter (µM). The first row specifies the unit of measurement (µM), while the second row indicates that the TBARS are specifically quantifying malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. This data is typically used to assess oxidative stress in various biological samples."
