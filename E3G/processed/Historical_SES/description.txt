"This dataset appears to contain socio-economic information with three columns: 'proyecto', 'folio', and 'nivsoc'. The 'nivsoc' column represents the historical socio-economic status (SES) categories, which are defined in detail. There are five categories ranging from 'Nivel austero y bajo nivel de vida' indicating an austere level and low standard of living, to 'Nivel de ingreso mas alto' which signifies the highest income level. The descriptions provide a clear understanding of the socio-economic stratification within the dataset."
