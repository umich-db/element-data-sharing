"This dataset appears to be related to a biomedical or biochemical study, with each column representing a different parameter. The 'FOLIOCC' column likely contains unique identifiers for the subjects or samples. 'X8_isoprostane' refers to the measured levels of 8-isoprostane, a biomarker of oxidative stress. 'StdDev' stands for the standard deviation of the measurements, indicating variability. 'PercentCV' is the percent coefficient of variation, which provides a normalized measure of dispersion relative to the mean, and 'StdErr' represents the standard error of the mean, which estimates the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean."
