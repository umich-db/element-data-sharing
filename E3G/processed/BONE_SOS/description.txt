"This dataset, part of the R01MB-M_BONE project, focuses on bone density measurements using radio and tibia sonometry (SOS). It includes variables such as patient identifiers, visit dates, and sonometry measurements like SOS, T-scores, and Z-scores for both radio and tibia, captured in meters per second and as statistical indices. The dataset also contains descriptive fields for special cases where measurements were not conducted. The project aims to analyze bone density through historical projects, with data categorized by various identifiers and measurement values."
