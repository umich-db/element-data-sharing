"This dataset appears to be a comprehensive metabolomics dataset, with each row representing a metabolite feature characterized by a unique 'Metab ID'. The dataset includes information on the metabolite's mass ('Mass'), retention time ('RT'), ionization mode ('Mode'), and exact mass ('Exact.Mass'). It also categorizes metabolites into clustering groups ('Clusting Group', 'Clustering Group Number') and provides details on their biochemical pathways ('Super.Pathway', 'Sub.Pathway'). Additionally, the dataset contains identifiers such as 'Lipid.Maps.ID', structural information like 'Chain' and 'Unsaturation', source database ('Database'), and quantitative data such as 'Median.Intensity', 'Mass.Diff', and 'KMD'. The columns labeled 'X40', 'X66', 'X76', etc., likely represent individual samples or experimental conditions with corresponding intensity values for each metabolite feature."
