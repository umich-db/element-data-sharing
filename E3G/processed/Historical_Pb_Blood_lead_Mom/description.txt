"This dataset appears to be related to a study tracking blood lead levels in mothers and their newborns. The columns include identifiers for the project ('PROYECTO') and individual files ('FOLIO'), as well as a series of measurements for maternal blood lead levels at various stages: during each trimester of pregnancy ('PB_M_11', 'PB_M_12', 'PB_M_13'), at delivery ('PB_M_20'), and at multiple postpartum intervals (one month 'PB_M_21', three months 'PB_M_23', four months 'PB_M_24', seven months 'PB_M_27', and twelve months 'PB_M_212'). Additionally, the dataset contains a measurement for cord blood lead levels ('PB_CORD'), which can indicate the exposure of the fetus to lead during pregnancy."
