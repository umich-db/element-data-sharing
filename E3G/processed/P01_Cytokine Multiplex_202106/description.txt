"This dataset contains information on various interleukins and tumor necrosis factors measured in serum samples, with each sample identified by a unique Sample_ID and associated with a specific subject through the Foliocc identifier. The dataset includes measurements for interleukins IL10, IL1b, IL4, IL6, and IL8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), presented in pg/mL. Additionally, it provides data on the coefficient of variation (CV) and limit of detection (LOD) for these cytokines, indicating the reliability and sensitivity of the measurements. The samples are organized into batches, with up to 38 samples per batch, across a total of 11 batches."
