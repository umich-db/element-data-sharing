"This dataset comprises various biological and technical variables collected from EPIC array analyses, primarily focusing on epigenetic age and cellular composition estimations. Key variables include barcode identifiers, sample names, and batch variables such as EPIC_Round, Sample_Plate, and Array details, which are crucial for managing batch effects during analysis. Biological data points include estimated proportions of different cell types (e.g., CD8T, CD4T, NK, Bcell) and epigenetic age indicators like DNAmAge, AgeAccelerationDiff, and various residuals from epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge). The dataset also includes variables for modeling outcomes such as intrinsic and extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA, EEAA), emphasizing the need to consider cell type proportions as potential confounders in analyses."
