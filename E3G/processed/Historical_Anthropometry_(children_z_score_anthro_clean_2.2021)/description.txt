"This dataset contains anthropometric measurements of children from birth to 60 months, including variables such as 'PROYECTO', 'FOLIO', 'FOLIOCC', 'stage', 'weight', 'height', and z-scores for weight-for-length/height ('_zwfl'). The data was collected by trained personnel following research protocols, and the measurements were used to calculate z-scores based on WHO standards. Data cleaning involved removing implausible weight and height values and reviewing z-scores, with new variables ('weight_n', 'height_n', 'z_clean') created to reflect these adjustments. The dataset also tracks growth trajectories by examining changes in z-scores over consecutive visits, with extreme changes being excluded from the analysis. Each entry includes an 'observation' field detailing reasons for data exclusion, ensuring the integrity of the dataset for studying child growth patterns."
