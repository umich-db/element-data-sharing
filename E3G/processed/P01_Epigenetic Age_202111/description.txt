"This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of variables related to epigenetic age calculations, derived from DNA methylation data. It includes basic identifiers like Sample_Name and Sample_Plate, alongside more specialized variables such as various age acceleration measures (AgeAccelerationDiff, AgeAccelerationResidual), cell type proportions (CD8T, CD4T, NK, Bcell, Mono, Gran), and advanced epigenetic markers (DNAmAge, DNAmGrimAge, DNAmPhenoAge). The data is used in conjunction with the online epigenetic clock software developed by Steve Horvath, which provides tools for calculating DNA methylation age and related metrics, crucial for research in biological age and associated health conditions. The software and its accompanying manual outline detailed instructions for data preparation, submission, and interpretation of results, emphasizing its utility as a research tool and the importance of accurate data handling."
