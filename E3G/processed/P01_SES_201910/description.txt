"This dataset contains a variety of socio-economic and household attributes collected under the \"SES-Triada\" survey. It includes detailed variables such as education level, household amenities, and assets, each encoded with specific numeric values representing different categories. For instance, 'esc_amai' details education levels ranging from no education to a doctorate degree, while 'vn10' and 'vn11' represent the number of rooms and bathrooms respectively. Additionally, the dataset incorporates AMAI standards for socio-economic status (SES) with scores and categories for better socio-economic classification, such as 'amai_13x6' and 'amai_8x7' which classify households from high to low SES based on various household characteristics."
