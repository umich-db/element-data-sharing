"This dataset contains epigenetic analysis data from DNA samples purified from cord blood, specifically from umbilical cord blood leukocytes of Cohort 1 participants. It includes information on DNA methylation percentages at various CpG sites for genes such as LINE1, H19, HSD11B2, and IGF2, with adjustments made for batch effects. The dataset also provides metadata such as the project name, participant details, sample IDs, and the pyrosequencing plates used for analysis. Missing data points due to technical assay failures are indicated, and notes on data quality are included where applicable. The analytical method used across the dataset is pyrosequencing, as conducted in the Dolinoy lab."
