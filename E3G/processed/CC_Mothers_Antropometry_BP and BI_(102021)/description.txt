"This dataset appears to be related to a cohort study focusing on mother and child anthropometry and health data. It includes identifiers such as 'proyecto' for the cohort group, 'folio' and 'foliocc' for participant folios, and 'etapa' indicating the visit stage. Health-related measurements for mothers are recorded, including height ('height_m'), weight ('weight_m'), BMI ('bmi_m'), waist circumference ('waist_m'), blood pressure ('dias_left_m', 'syst_left_m', etc.), skinfold thickness ('pse_m', 'psi_m', 'plb_m'), and body composition ('fat_m', 'fatp_m', 'ffm_m', 'ffmp_m'). Child data includes date of birth ('fechanac_ch'), sex ('sex_ch'), and age at the time of visit ('edad_ch'). The dataset also tracks the date of visit ('fecha_visita') and the date when anthropometric measures were taken ('date_antro')."
