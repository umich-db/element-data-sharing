"This dataset appears to be a structured assessment tool used to evaluate the home environment of adolescents aged 11 to 15 years, as developed by Bettye M. Caldwell and Robert H. Bradley. It includes a form for recording family details, such as the adolescent's name, age, sex, family composition, parental education levels, and whether the teenager works or attends school. The dataset also contains a scoring system with subscales that assess various aspects of the home environment, including the physical environment, learning materials, modeling, self-sufficiency, regulatory activities, family involvement, and acceptance. Each item is marked with a plus or minus to indicate the presence or absence of specific conditions or behaviors, and the data is collected through observation, interview, or both."
