"This dataset contains a variety of health-related measurements for subjects across different cohorts. Each variable, such as unique subject ID (FOLIOCC), gender (SEXO_H), age (cd_age), weight, height, waist circumference, skinfold thicknesses (tri_skin, sup_skin, sub_skin), and blood pressure (pr_dias, pr_sis), is described in terms of its definition, scale, and whether it is a derived variable. Derived variables include age in months (_agemons), BMI (_CBMI), and various z-scores for weight, height, and BMI (_ZWFA, _ZHFA, _ZBFA) calculated using WHO growth reference standards. Flags indicating extreme z-score values are also provided (_FWFA, _FHFA, _FBFA). The dataset is structured to facilitate detailed health and growth analysis within and across different cohorts."
