"This dataset appears to be a structured assessment tool used to evaluate the family environment and developmental opportunities for children aged 6 to 10 years, as created by Bettye M. Caldwell and Robert H. Bradley. It includes a form for recording family details, such as the child's name, age, sex, family composition, parental education, and primary provider, along with a section for remarks and observations. The dataset also contains a summary sheet and detailed items across eight subscales, including Parental Sensitivity, Encouraging Maturity, Emotional Climate, Materials and Opportunities to Learn, Enrichment, Family Accompaniment, Integrated Family, and Physical Environment. Each item is to be marked with a plus or minus to indicate the presence or absence of specific behaviors or conditions, and the dataset provides spaces for scoring and evaluator feedback."
