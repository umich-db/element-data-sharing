"This dataset contains columns labeled 'foliocc', 'etapa', 'Sedantary', 'Light', 'Moderate', 'Vigorous', and 'TotalTime'. The first row categorizes the types of activities into Sedentary, Light, Moderate, and Vigorous, along with the Total Time spent on all activities. The second row specifies the time duration for each activity type: Sedentary time, Light Activity time, Moderate Activity time, Vigorous Activity time, and the Total Time spent on all activities combined. This dataset is likely used to analyze the activity patterns of individuals at different stages or conditions indicated by 'etapa'."
