"This dataset contains historical bone lead measurements for patella and tibia, collected using K-XRF2 and K-XRF4 equipment. The dataset includes original variables and reanalysis data, with measurements spanning from 1993 to 2011. The dataset accounts for equipment failures, software updates, and reanalysis periods, which have impacted the availability and accuracy of the measurements. Negative values, indicative of measurements below the detection limit, are present and require special handling. The dataset also provides a proposed methodology for combining original and reanalyzed measurements, handling negative values, and calculating weighted averages for further analysis. The dataset is structured with columns for project identifiers, folio numbers, measurement stages, bone dates, and various lead measurements with their corresponding imprecisions. It also includes cohort-specific observations and statistical analyses comparing original and reanalyzed data."
