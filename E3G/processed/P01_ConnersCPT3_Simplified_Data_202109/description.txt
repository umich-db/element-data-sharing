"This dataset is structured to provide detailed insights from the Conners Continuous Performance Test 3 (CPT3), which assesses attention-related problems in individuals. The dataset includes multiple columns such as 'PROYECTO', 'FOLIO', 'ID', 'ETAPA', and various metrics like 'c_t', 'dpr_t', 'omi_t', among others, which represent different test scores and reaction times. Descriptive legends explain the coding for gender, assessment times, response styles, and various test scores, both raw and transformed. Additionally, the dataset outlines the test structure, detailing the number of trials, sub-blocks, blocks, and inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) in milliseconds, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing the test results."
