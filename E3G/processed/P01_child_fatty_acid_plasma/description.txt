"This dataset is a comprehensive collection of fatty acid data derived from 405 fasted plasma samples of Mexican adolescents, analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography at the University of Michigan Metabolomics Core. It includes 35 variables related to different types of fatty acids, such as saturated (S), monounsaturated (M), polyunsaturated (P), and trans fats (T), with each variable representing the percentage of total fatty acids. The data dictionary provides detailed descriptions and classifications for each fatty acid variable, including trivial names and carbon chain configurations. Researchers utilizing this dataset are advised to acknowledge the Metabolomics Core Services supported by NIH and the University of Michigan Momentum Center."
