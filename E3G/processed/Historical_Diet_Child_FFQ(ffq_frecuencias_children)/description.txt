"This dataset appears to be a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) tailored for children under the age of 5, capturing detailed dietary intake information across various food categories. The columns include identifiers like 'PROYECTO', 'FOLIO', and personal attributes such as 'EDAD_SNUT' (age), 'SEXO' (gender), and 'EDAD' (age). The bulk of the dataset consists of 'FREC' columns, each representing the frequency of consumption of different food items, with corresponding descriptions in both Spanish and English. The dataset also includes codes for the frequency of consumption, such as '1 = never' or '2 = less than once per month', and categorizes foods into groups like milk products, fruits, meats, vegetables, and beverages. Additional columns towards the end define food groups and provide aggregated data for dietary analysis."
