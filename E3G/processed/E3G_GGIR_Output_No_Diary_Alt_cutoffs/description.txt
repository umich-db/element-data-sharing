This dataset captures detailed daily wake and sleep patterns recorded over a seven-day period, calculated without the use of a sleep diary. It includes variables such as participant identifiers, the day of the week, and the sequence of the day within the seven-day wear period. The dataset provides comprehensive metrics on total wake time, total sleep time, and various categories of wake time, including inactive, light, moderate, and vigorous activity levels, all derived independently of sleep diary data. Additionally, it tracks the percentage of time the accelerometer was not worn, offering a complete view of participants' daily routines and physical activity across the observation period.
