"This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of variables related to DNA methylation data, primarily derived from EPIC array analyses. Key variables include barcode identifiers, sample names, and various epigenetic clocks such as Horvath, Hannum, and Wu's clocks, which estimate biological age based on DNA methylation patterns. Batch variables like PC1-PC5, which account for variability in control probe data, and estimated proportions of different cell types (e.g., B cells, CD4+ T-cells) using the Houseman method are also included. Recommendations for analysis often suggest modeling these variables as outcomes of interest or considering them as confounders, depending on the variable type."
