"This dataset appears to be related to a cohort study involving anthropometric measurements of children and their mothers. It includes variables such as project identifiers, participant folios, visit stages, dates of birth and visits, sex and age of the child, as well as detailed anthropometric data like height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference for both children and mothers. Additional variables include age-specific z-scores such as WAZ (Weight for Age Z-score), HAZ (Height for Age Z-score), and BAZ (BMI for Age Z-score), along with measurements of maternal body composition like fat mass and fat-free mass. The dataset is structured with variable names, descriptions, and values, with some fields containing categorical codes (e.g., V0 for Visit 1) and observations for clarification."
