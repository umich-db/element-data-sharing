"This dataset appears to be a structured collection of health screening questionnaires focused on periodontal review, with each record containing a variety of attributes related to the participant's health and personal information. The columns include identifiers such as 'proyecto', 'folio', and 'id', as well as demographic details like 'etapa', 'participante', 'edad', and the date of the interview ('fecha', 'f_dia', 'f_mes', 'f_anio'). Health-related questions are represented by binary variables ('tz_1' to 'tz_11') indicating the presence or absence of specific conditions, with additional text fields ('tz_1esp' to 'tz_8esp') for specifying details about certain conditions. The dataset also includes a numerical value for capillary glucose ('gulcosa'). Each health condition or screening question is associated with a binary response option, where '1' denotes 'Yes' and '2' denotes 'No'."
