"This dataset contains epigenetic analysis data from a cholesterol study, specifically focusing on DNA methylation at various CpG sites of the LINE1, H19, and HSD11B2 genes, collected during the P20 visit. The data has been adjusted for batch effects, with specific methods for adjustment detailed for each gene. Methylation percentages at multiple CpG sites are provided, with adjustments made by either subtracting the 0% control value or normalizing to the average of all 100% controls for the same site and batch. Missing data points are noted as a result of failed assays. Additional information includes the pyrosequencing plate dates, sample types, participant details, and the analytical methods used in the Dolinoy lab for each genic region."
