This dataset is focused on biochemical and hormonal measurements collected from participants in a study or survey. It includes various variables such as participant identifiers, stages of data collection, and specific biochemical markers. The dataset contains detailed measurements of several hormones and biochemical markers including C-peptide, IGF-1, adiponectin, leptin, AMH (Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone), estradiol, FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone), LH (Luteinizing Hormone), progesterone, and testosterone. Additionally, it includes common metabolic markers such as cholesterol levels, glucose, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. Each biochemical marker is recorded alongside its corresponding batch information to ensure accuracy and traceability. The dataset is structured to capture both the raw measurements and related comments that provide context or notes about the data collected.
