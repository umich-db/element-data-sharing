"This dataset appears to be related to a cohort study involving mother and child anthropometry, with multiple cohorts and visits indicated. It includes identifiers such as 'proyecto' for the cohort group, 'folio' and 'foliocc' for participant folios, and 'stage' and 'etapa' for visit stages. The dataset contains personal information such as the child's date of birth ('fechanac_ch'), sex ('sex_ch'), and age at the time of visit ('edad_ch'), as well as the mother's anthropometric measurements including height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure ('height_m', 'weight_m', 'bmi_m', 'waist_m', 'dias_left_m', 'syst_left_m', etc.). Additionally, it records body composition data for the mother, such as fat mass ('fat_ch'), percent of fat mass ('fatp_ch'), fat-free mass ('ffm_ch'), and percent fat-free mass ('ffmp_ch')."
