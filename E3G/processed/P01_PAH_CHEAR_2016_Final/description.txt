"This dataset contains information on various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) analyzed under the UPAH panel. Each row, from the second to the ninth, lists a specific hydroxylated PAH compound, providing details such as the full analyte name, analyte code, CAS number, measurement units, and limit of detection (LOD) in ng/L. The dataset includes analytes like 2-hydroxyfluorene, 1-hydroxynaphthalene, and several hydroxyphenanthrenes, among others. The first row serves as a header, outlining the structure of the dataset with columns for the full panel name, analysis panel, full analyte name, analyte code, CAS number, units, and LOD."
