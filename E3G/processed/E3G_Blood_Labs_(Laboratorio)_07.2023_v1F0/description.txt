The dataset also contains cholesterol levels (chol), glucose (gluc_god), HDL cholesterol (hdl_c), and triglycerides (trig), as well as absolute counts of different types of white blood cells like neutrophils (ne_n) and lymphocytes (ly_n). Each entry is associated with a unique identifier (id), the participant's name, the stage of the project (etapa), and the date of the study (fecha), along with other project-specific details."
