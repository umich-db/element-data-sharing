"This dataset contains detailed information on various cognitive and attention tests administered to participants, identified by a unique subject ID ('foliocc'). It includes data from different stages and instruments, such as the NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and the NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test, available in multiple versions based on age and language. The dataset records raw scores, item counts, computed scores, and several types of standardized scores (uncorrected, age-corrected, and fully-corrected T-scores) to evaluate participant performance against national norms. Additionally, it tracks whether the test was completed, reasons for any interruptions, and provides fields for additional comments on such interruptions."
