"The dataset titled \"CC_Children_Sexual_Maturation\" contains a variety of variables related to the sexual maturation of children. It includes personal identifiers such as 'proyecto', 'folio', and 'foliocc', as well as demographic information like 'etapa', 'sex_ch', 'sexo_mad', 'edad_ch', and 'edad_mad'. The dataset also records dates of birth, visits, and sexual maturity assessments ('fechanac_ch', 'fecha_visita', 'fecha_madurez'). Several questions pertain to puberty milestones, such as the onset of menstruation ('f5', 'f6'), pubic hair removal practices ('f7', 'm5'), and the development of secondary sexual characteristics ('f9', 'f10', 'm7', 'm8'). Each variable is categorized with a type, size, and a set of possible values, providing a structured approach to documenting the stages of sexual maturation in children."
