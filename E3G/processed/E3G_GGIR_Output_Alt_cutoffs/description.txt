This dataset captures activity and sleep patterns recorded over a seven-day period using a sleep diary and accelerometer data. It includes variables such as participant identifiers, the day of the week, and the sequence of the day within the seven-day wear period. The dataset provides detailed metrics on total wake time, total sleep time, and various categories of wake time, including inactive, light, moderate, and vigorous activity levels. Additionally, it includes data on the percentage of time the accelerometer was not worn, providing a comprehensive view of both sleep and physical activity throughout the observation period. Each variable is carefully recorded to ensure accurate reflection of participants' daily routines and sleep patterns.
