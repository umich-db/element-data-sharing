"This dataset is a comprehensive collection of dental records focusing on tooth conditions, specifically fluorosis, across various stages and subjects. Each record includes detailed assessments of individual teeth, categorized by their position and surface (buccal, lingual, occlusal) with a severity rating ranging from normal to severe, including conditions where the tooth is missing. The dataset is structured with multiple attributes such as 'FOLIOCC', 'etapa', 'stage', and date fields, alongside detailed descriptors for each tooth condition, coded with specific values to indicate the severity of fluorosis. Additionally, the dataset includes identifiers for the subjects and the examiners, enhancing the traceability and reliability of the data."
