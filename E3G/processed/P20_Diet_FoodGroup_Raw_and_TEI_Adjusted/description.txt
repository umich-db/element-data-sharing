"This dataset appears to be a comprehensive food consumption database that includes various food groups and individual food items commonly consumed in a specific population, possibly in Mexico given the Spanish descriptions. The columns include identifiers for food groups both in raw and total energy intake (TEI)-adjusted forms, as well as detailed descriptions in English and Spanish. Each row represents a different food item or group, with information on the food variable name in the database and its description in both languages. The dataset covers a wide range of food categories, from dairy products, fruits, meats, and vegetables to beverages, grains, sweets, and traditional Mexican foods, with additional columns for adjusted intake based on TEI."
