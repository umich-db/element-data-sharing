"This dataset appears to track blood lead levels in children over time as part of a health or environmental study. The columns include identifiers for the project ('PROYECTO') and individual records ('FOLIO'), followed by a series of measurements taken at various ages from 1 to 60 months ('PB_C_1' through 'PB_C_60'). The measurements alternate between capillary and venous blood lead levels, indicating the method by which the blood samples were obtained. The dataset is structured to facilitate longitudinal analysis of lead exposure in children from infancy through early childhood."
