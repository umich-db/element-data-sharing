"This dataset contains variables used in Christina's manuscript to explore the relationship between dynamic features of infants and prenatal exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) across three trimesters. The variables include 'TimingPeak_unadj' and 'TimingPeak_adj', which represent the time to the BMI peak as extracted from Newton's Growth Model, both unadjusted and adjusted for covariates like cohort, sex, gestational age, and mother's BMI postpartum. Another variable, 't_stblz_WFL', indicates the time to stabilization of the weight/length velocity ratio, also derived from Newton's Growth Model without adjustments. These variables help in understanding critical growth milestones in infants up to 3 years of age."
