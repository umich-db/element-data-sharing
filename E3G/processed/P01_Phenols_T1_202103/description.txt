"This dataset contains various chemical analytes and their respective levels of detection across different samples, identified by columns such as 'foliocc', 'etapa', and 'batch'. The dataset includes specific gravity measurements and phenol units, along with concentrations of various compounds like Benzophenone-3, Bisphenol A, Bisphenol F, Bisphenol S, and different types of parabens and dichlorophenols. Each chemical compound is also associated with its level of detection (LOD), providing insights into the sensitivity of the measurements for each analyte. This comprehensive dataset is crucial for analyzing the presence and concentration of these chemicals in environmental or biological samples."
