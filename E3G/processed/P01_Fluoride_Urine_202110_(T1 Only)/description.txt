"This dataset contains information related to the fluoride content in plasma or urine samples across different cohorts. The columns include identifiers like 'PROYECTO' for the cohort, 'FOLIO' for the cohort-specific ID, and 'ID' for the sample ID. It also includes measurements from two aliquots ('_F_u_ml_A' and '_F_u_ml_B'), their mean, error, standard deviation, and percent relative standard deviation. The dataset is structured to assist in the analysis of fluoride levels in various stages and cohorts, denoted by 'Etapa' and 'Stage'."
