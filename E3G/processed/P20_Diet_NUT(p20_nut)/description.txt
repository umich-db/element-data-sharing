"This dataset appears to be a comprehensive nutritional database that includes a wide array of food components, ranging from macronutrients like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals. It contains columns for both the nutrient content of foods (e.g., 'ener_kcal' for energy in kilocalories, 'proteina' for protein content, 'grasa' for fat content) and their chemical constituents (e.g., 'cafeina' for caffeine, 'thebrn' for theobromine). Additionally, the dataset includes information on food fortification (e.g., 'fortica' for calcium-fortified foods, 'fortife' for iron-fortified foods), the type of food (e.g., raw, cooked, or prepared), and the density of liquids. Descriptive fields provide details such as the source of data, food group classification, and identifiers for specific nutrients like phytic acid, iron, and zinc. The dataset is structured to support a variety of analyses related to nutrition and food science."
