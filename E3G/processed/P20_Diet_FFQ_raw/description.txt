"This dataset appears to be related to a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and contains nine columns: 'folio', 'proyecto', 'food_code', 'food_name', 'ffq_applied', 'times_per_week', 'times_per_day', 'portion_size', and 'num_portions'. The first row of the dataset provides the column headers, while the second row provides a description of the data each column contains, such as the file or folio number, the project name, a unique code for each food item, the name of the food, whether the FFQ was applied, the frequency of consumption per week and per day, the size of a single portion, and the number of portions consumed. This dataset is likely used to assess dietary intake and eating habits of individuals within a specific project or study."
