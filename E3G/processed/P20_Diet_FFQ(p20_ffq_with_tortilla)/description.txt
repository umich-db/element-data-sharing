"This dataset provides a comprehensive list of food items along with their nutritional content, including macronutrients and micronutrients such as proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Each food item is identified with specific codes and descriptions, including its source of homologation for macronutrients and micronutrients, and whether it is fortified with certain nutrients like calcium, iron, or vitamins. The dataset also categorizes foods based on their processing level and includes specific identifiers for foods fortified or enriched, which is crucial for nutritional studies and dietary planning. Additionally, it covers a wide range of food groups, making it a valuable resource for nutritional analysis and health-related research."
