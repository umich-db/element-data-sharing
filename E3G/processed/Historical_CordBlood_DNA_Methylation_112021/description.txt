"This dataset, titled 'Historical_CordBlood_DNA_Methylation_112021', contains epigenetic data from umbilical cord blood leukocyte DNA, specifically focusing on DNA methylation levels at various CpG sites. The dataset includes variables for project identifiers, folio numbers, and batch-adjusted methylation percentages for three genes: LINE1, H19, and HSD11B2, across multiple CpG sites. Methylation percentages have been adjusted for batch effects using control values, and missing data points are indicated by \". cells\" due to failed assays. Pyrosequencing was the analytical method used to measure methylation at these specific sites, providing insights into the epigenetic regulation at birth."
