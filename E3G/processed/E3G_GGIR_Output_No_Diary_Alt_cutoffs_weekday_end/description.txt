This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of average daily wake and sleep patterns, calculated independently of sleep diary data. It includes variables such as participant identifiers, total average wake time, and total average sleep time. The dataset further breaks down wake time into various activity levels, including inactive, light, moderate, and vigorous, all averaged over the observation period. Additionally, it records the percentage of time the accelerometer was not worn, along with the number of days considered in the weekday or weekend calculations. The data distinguishes between weekday and weekend patterns, offering insights into how daily routines differ across these periods.
