"This dataset appears to be a structured collection of responses from a health oral questionnaire, with fields capturing various aspects of dental health and hygiene practices among participants. The columns include identifiers such as 'proyecto', 'folio', and 'foliocc', personal information like 'participante', 'EDAD', and 'fecha' of the interview, as well as a series of questions ('PREG1' to 'PREG12') that inquire about the last dental visit, reasons for visiting, frequency of dental issues, and oral hygiene habits. Each question has predefined response options, with codes for different answers, including options for non-response or uncertainty. Observations and additional notes are recorded under 'OBS'. The dataset is likely used for analyzing oral health trends and could be part of a larger study indicated by the manual reference \"R24-F0_Cuestionario Salud Oral_Manual\"."
