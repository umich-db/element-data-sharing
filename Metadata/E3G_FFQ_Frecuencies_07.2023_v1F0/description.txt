"This dataset appears to be a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire from the National Institute of Public Health's National Health and Nutrition Survey 2006, focusing on individuals over 12 years old. It includes detailed columns for various food items and beverages, portion sizes, and the frequency of consumption over the past 7 days. The questionnaire is structured to capture the number of days each food item was consumed and the number of times per day, with specific portion size options ranging from very small to extra large. Additionally, there are sections for miscellaneous items like condiments and tortillas, as well as a final question about the respondent's perception of their reported consumption compared to their normal diet."
