"This dataset contains immunological data from various samples, with each sample having a unique Sample_number and Sample_ID. The dataset includes measurements of cytokines such as Interleukin 10 (IL10), Interleukin 1 beta (IL1b), Interleukin 4 (IL4), Interleukin 6 (IL6), Interleukin 8 (IL8), and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNFa) in picograms per milliliter (pg/mL). Additionally, it provides information on the coefficient of variation (CV) for duplicate samples with a CV greater than 20% (denoted by IL10_CV, IL1b_CV, etc.), and whether the cytokine levels are below the limit of detection (LOD) (indicated by IL10_LOD, IL1b_LOD, etc.). The dataset also includes a unique subject identifier (Foliocc), the stage of the sample (Etapa), and the batch information indicating that there were a total of 11 batches, with each Cytokine Multiplex Panel capable of holding up to 38 samples."
