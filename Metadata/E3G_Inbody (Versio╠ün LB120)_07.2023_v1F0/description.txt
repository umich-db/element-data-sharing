"This dataset appears to be a comprehensive collection of body composition measurements and related data, likely gathered using an InBody device, which is a tool for analyzing an individual's physical status. The columns include identifiers like 'proyecto', 'folio', and 'USER_ID', personal information such as 'fecha' (date), 'lugar' (place), 'date_birth', 'Gender', and 'Age', as well as a wide array of body composition metrics including 'Height', 'Weight', 'BMI' (Body Mass Index), 'TBW' (Total Body Water), 'Protein', 'Minerals', 'BFM' (Body Fat Mass), 'FFM' (Fat Free Mass), 'SMM' (Skeletal Muscle Mass), 'PBF' (Percent Body Fat), and 'BMR' (Basal Metabolic Rate). It also contains detailed segmental body composition analysis like 'FFM of Right Arm', 'BFM of Trunk', and 'PBF of Left Leg', among others, as well as impedance measurements at different frequencies, which are used to estimate body composition. The dataset includes normal range limits for many of the metrics, which can be used for health and fitness assessments."
